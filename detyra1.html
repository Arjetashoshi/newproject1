    <strong>Tiramisu</strong> is a timeless no-bake Italian dessert combining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and a creamy lightly sweetened mascarpone cream. This recipe is from the late Maida Heatter and is easily the best homemade tiramisu recipe that Iâ€™ve ever tried.

    <h3><b> Common Tiramisu Questions - Answered</b></h3>
   </p>

   <b>
    What kind of rum do I use in tiramisu?</b>
   </p>
 <p>
Dark rum is best,but you can use brandy or your favorite coffe liqueur.</p>
<p>  <b>Egg whites or whipped cream? </b> </p>
<p>
    Most tiramisu recipes use whipped egg whites or whipped cream in the mascarpone cream layers.Egg whites contribute a more airy texture,while the whipped cream makes the filling a bit more rich.This recipe actually uses both,so you're getting both delightful textures.
</p>
<p> <b> Are the eggs cooked?</b></p>

<p>
    Tiramisu is a no-bake dessert.The egg yolks are gently cooked on the stovetop,but the egg whites are raw.Purchase pasteurized eggs because they are safe to consume raw.

</p>
<p>  <b> What size pan to use?</b></p>
<p>
    This particular tiramisu recipe yields a large volume and the pan will be very full.Make sure your pan is large enough.I recommend a 9x13 inch dish with at least a 12-14 cup capacity.This 4 quart dish is wonderful too.
